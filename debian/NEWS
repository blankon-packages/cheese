lightdm (1.0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting 1.0.10, the greeters choice is not handled anymore through debconf
  calls (which causes bugs because it modifies a conffile provided by another
  package, lightdm), but using alternatives.

  You can change the greeter using:

    update-alternatives --config lightdm-greeter

  Before that works, you need to make sure the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file
  is updated so the currently chosen greeter is the alternative. You can check
  that by using the following command:

    grep '^greeter-session=' /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

  which should return: greeter-session=lightdm-greeter. If you accept the
  conffile modification it'll be handled automatically, but you might want to
  do it manually if you refuse the automatic update.

  You can also do nothing and keep going with your current greeter choice,
  this will continue to run as long as the corresponding greeter stays
  installed.
